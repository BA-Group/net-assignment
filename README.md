# ASP.NET assigment

This is a .NET version of the [Play & ReactiveMongo, assignment](https://github.com/BA-Group/play-assignment). Build using ASP.NET stack, Dapper ORM and SQLite. Goal is roughly the same as with play-assignment but tools are little different and perhaps more comfortable for people with C# background.

The main goal here is just get ContactControllerShould.cs test run nicely with dotnet test command
